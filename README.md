Cryptomoney for the people, especially the poors!

I wanna solve the problem of bitcoin, that most of the rich people will stay rich. So there could be a new way of mining, for example as a citizen of India or any country where a lot poverty is around, you mine a bit more than anyone in the US 
and of course a lot of other criteria that can be set by community.
